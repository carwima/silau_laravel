This is my embarassing atempt of uploading laravel file

in the past, i thought git is somekind of remote drive where you just upload
now i know it's more of version control, collaboration, etc.Cancel changes

Anw, free to unzip it, it's a working CRUD,
but instead of eloquent, i'm using DBQuery. Why? because it's closest to playing with MySQL
I didn't use artisan Migrate because my Model knowledge is poor backthen. But yeah, baby steps~

##smh this is hillarious, way to go me.
